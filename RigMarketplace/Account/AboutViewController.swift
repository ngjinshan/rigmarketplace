        Welcome to the Rig Marketplace
        
        The Rig Marketplace is a mobile application that serves as a platform for users interested in building custom-built computers, commonly known as "rigs". In today's fast-paced world of computer technology, it's essential to have a reliable and convenient marketplace for buying and selling computer parts.
        
        Custom-built computers have become increasingly popular, with many companies specializing in their sales. However, due to the rapid growth of computer parts, such as the evolution of graphic cards over the years, there is a tendency to replace parts with newer versions. That's where The Rig Marketplace comes in!

        One of the key features of this application is that it provides users with a centralized marketplace to buy and sell computer parts. Whether you're looking to upgrade your rig or want to find cheaper second-hand computer parts, our marketplace has got you covered. Say goodbye to the hassle of searching through various websites and forums â€“ we bring everything together in one convenient place.

        But The Rig Marketplace is more than just a marketplace. We believe in empowering our users with the tools and knowledge to build their dream rigs. That's why we've included a virtual assistant that will guide and assist you throughout the entire process. From selecting the right components to ensuring compatibility, our virtual assistant has got your back.

        Additionally, we understand the importance of community and sharing ideas. That's why we've created a community forum where users can connect, share their rigs, and discuss their experiences. Not only can you showcase your rig, but you can also provide a full component-price breakdown, helping others make informed decisions.

        The Rig Marketplace is designed with gamers and students in mind, as these audiences are often passionate about custom-built computers. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality and affordable computer parts, and our app is here to make that a reality.
